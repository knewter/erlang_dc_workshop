    of the basics of Elixir, if that makes any sense.</p>

  <h1>List Comprehensions</h1>
  <h2>What are they for?</h2>
  <pre class='fragment'><code>iex(1)> lc x inlist [1, 2, 3, 4], do: x*2&#x000A;[2, 4, 6, 8]&#x000A;&#x000A;iex(3)> lc x inlist [1, 2, 3, 4], do: [x, x*2]&#x000A;[[1, 2], [2, 4], [3, 6], [4, 8]]&#x000A;&#x000A;iex(6)> lc x inlist [1, 2, 3, 4], rem(x, 2) == 0, do: x&#x000A;[2, 4]&#x000A;</code></pre>
  <aside class='notes'>
    <p>The general idea behind List Comprehensions is to create a list from one or more
    other lists.  Let&#39;s look at some basic examples:  [advance]</p>
    
    <p>From this we get the general principle - for each x in some list, return an
    element for a new list.  We also might create a filter to filter out some
    potential elements.  From what we&#39;ve seen so far, this doesn&#39;t seem like much
    more than some syntactic sugar for mapping lists.  It gets better though :)</p>

  <h1>List Comprehensions</h1>
  <h2>Combining Multiple Lists</h2>
  <pre class='fragment'><code>iex(1)> lc x inlist [1, 2, 3], y inlist [4, 5, 6], do: x*y&#x000A;[4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 12, 15, 18]</code></pre>
  <pre class='fragment'><code>iex(3)> lc x inlist [1, 2, 3], y inlist [4, 5, 6], do: {x, y}&#x000A;[{1, 4}, {1, 5}, {1, 6}, {2, 4}, {2, 5}, {2, 6}, {3, 4}, {3, 5}, {3, 6}]</code></pre>
  <pre class='fragment'><code>iex(13)> lc x inlist [1, 3, 5, 7, 9],&#x000A;            y inlist [2, 4, 6, 8, 10],&#x000A;            rem((x*y)-1, 9) == 0,&#x000A;            do: [x, y]&#x000A;[[1, 10], [5, 2], [7, 4]]</code></pre>
  <aside class='notes'>
    <p>Let&#39;s look at combining a couple of lists: [advance]</p>
    
    <p>So what happened there?  For each x in the first list, it generated an element
    for the output list that consisted of that x * each y in the list.  Of course,
    the output for a list comprehension can get more interesting.</p>
    
    <p>For instance, you might want to generate a list of tuples: [advance]</p>
    
    <p>You can of course get a bit fancy.  Let&#39;s find all the numbers based on the
    first five odd numbers and the first five even numbers where the product minus 1
    is divisible by 9: [advance]</p>
    
    <p>This is, of course, a contrived example, but it was a pretty comprehensive use
    of the features provided by list comprehensions.  Let&#39;s go a little bit further.
    Let&#39;s test drive a module that will generate a deck of cards.</p>
    
    <p>I&#39;ve already got a test case shell for this.  We&#39;ll pull it up and see about
    making the tests pass.</p>

  <aside class='notes'>
    <p>I&#39;ve gone ahead and started a test shell case for this.</p>
    
    <pre><code>cp -r elixir_card_deck_prep_project elixir_card_deck&#x000A;cd elixir_card_deck&#x000A;</code></pre>
    
    <p>Let&#39;s go ahead and look at the test suite to see what this is going to do for
    us:</p>
    
    <pre><code>vim text/elixir_card_deck_test.exs&#x000A;</code></pre>
    
    <p>Alright, so it&#39;s pretty basic.  Basically, we want to generate a deck of cards.</p>
    
    <p>We&#39;re going to use List Comprehensions, as you might have guessed.  Let&#39;s focus
    on making the first test pass:</p>
    
    <pre><code>defmodule ElixirCardDeck do&#x000A;  use Application.Behaviour&#x000A;&#x000A;  # See http://elixir-lang.org/docs/stable/Application.Behaviour.html&#x000A;  # for more information on OTP Applications&#x000A;  def start(_type, _args) do&#x000A;    ElixirCardDeck.Supervisor.start_link&#x000A;  end&#x000A;&#x000A;  def make_deck do&#x000A;    lc suit inlist suits, value inlist values, do: {:card, value, suit}&#x000A;  end&#x000A;&#x000A;  defp suits do&#x000A;    [:spades]&#x000A;  end&#x000A;&#x000A;  defp values do&#x000A;    [:a]&#x000A;  end&#x000A;end&#x000A;</code></pre>
  </aside>
</section>
<section>
  <h1>LIVE LIVE LIVE LIVE LIVE</h1>

  <h1>ZOMG ZOMG ZOMG ZOMG</h1>
  <aside class='notes'>
    <p>So that gets one  of the tests passing very quickly.  The other one doesn&#39;t look
    very difficult to get done here either.</p>
    
    <pre><code>defmodule ElixirCardDeck do&#x000A;  use Application.Behaviour&#x000A;&#x000A;  # See http://elixir-lang.org/docs/stable/Application.Behaviour.html&#x000A;  # for more information on OTP Applications&#x000A;  def start(_type, _args) do&#x000A;    ElixirCardDeck.Supervisor.start_link&#x000A;  end&#x000A;&#x000A;  def make_deck do&#x000A;    lc value inlist values, suit inlist suits, do: {:card, value, suit}&#x000A;  end&#x000A;&#x000A;  defp suits do&#x000A;    [:spades, :clubs, :diamonds, :hearts]&#x000A;  end&#x000A;&#x000A;  defp values do&#x000A;    [:a, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, :j, :q, :k]&#x000A;  end&#x000A;end&#x000A;</code></pre>
    
    <p>Alright, run the tests and they pass.  That&#39;s basically it - building a deck of
    cards with list comprehensions in Elixir is mostly a one liner. That&#39;s it for
    List Comprehensions. (back to the slides)</p>

  <h1>Records</h1>
  <aside class='notes'>
    <p>In Elixir, it is common to represent structured data using Records.  Let&#39;s have
    a look at the basics of records, and see how they can be used in pattern matching.
    [advance]</p>
  </aside>
</section>
<section>
  <h1>Records</h1>
  <h2>Defining Them</h2>
  <pre class='fragment'><code>defrecord NewRecord, first_name: nil, last_name: "Dudington"&#x000A;# Make a new one, two different ways:&#x000A;dude = NewRecord.new first_name: "Dude"&#x000A;bro = NewRecord[first_name: "Bro"]&#x000A;dude.first_name&#x000A;dude.last_name&#x000A;bro.first_name&#x000A;bro.last_name&#x000A;</code></pre>
  <aside class='notes'>
    <p>You can define records easily using defrecord.  It returns a tuple representing the
    record: [advance]</p>
    
    <p>(do the following in an iex)</p>
    
    <pre><code>defrecord NewRecord, first_name: nil, last_name: &quot;Dudington&quot;&#x000A;# Make a new one, two different ways:&#x000A;dude = NewRecord.new first_name: &quot;Dude&quot;&#x000A;bro = NewRecord[first_name: &quot;Bro&quot;]&#x000A;dude.first_name #=&gt; &quot;Dude&quot;&#x000A;dude.last_name  #=&gt; &quot;Dudington&quot;&#x000A;bro.first_name  #=&gt; &quot;Bro&quot;&#x000A;bro.last_name   #=&gt; &quot;Dudington&quot;&#x000A;</code></pre>
    
    <p>(back to the slides)</p>
    
    <p>Records are just modules - nothing more, nothing less.  You can define them in the
    block style, and define functions on them as well: [advance]</p>
  </aside>
</section>
<section>
  <h1>Records</h1>
  <h2>Defining Them</h2>
  <pre><code>defrecord Person, first_name: nil, last_name: "Dudington" do&#x000A;  def name(record) do&#x000A;    "#{record.first_name} #{record.last_name}"&#x000A;  end&#x000A;end&#x000A;guy = Person.new first_name: "Guy"&#x000A;guy.name #=> "Guy Dudington"</code></pre>
  <pre class='fragment'><code>Person.name(guy) #=> "Guy Dudington"</code></pre>
  <pre class='fragment'><code>fake_person = {Person, "fake", "person"}&#x000A;fake_person.name #=> "fake person"</code></pre>
  <aside class='notes'>
    <p>This looks a lot like classes/objects in Ruby - state and behaviour as one.
    However, it&#39;s generally frowned upon to do this, and things will likely be
    better if, for instance, you were just to define a PersonPrinter module that had
    functions meant to operate upon a Person record.  Alternatively, if you just used
    the module in the more traditional manner (rather than via object-style dots) by doing
    something like this: [advance]</p>
    
    <p>Records are really just syntactic sugar on tuples.  You can see this by creating
    the appropriate kind of tuple, and seeing it behave as if it were a record
    &quot;instance&quot;: [advance]</p>
  </aside>
</section>
<section>
  <h1>Records</h1>
  <h2>Pattern Matching</h2>
  <pre class='fragment'><code>defmodule PersonPrinter do&#x000A;  def say_hello(Person[first_name: first, last_name: "Dudington"]) do&#x000A;    "hey it's my brother, #{first}!"&#x000A;  end&#x000A;&#x000A;  def say_hello(Person[first_name: first]) do&#x000A;    "hello, #{first}"&#x000A;  end&#x000A;end&#x000A;&#x000A;bro = Person.new first_name: "Bro", last_name: "Dudington"&#x000A;stranger = Person.new first_name: "Stranger", last_name: "von Strangehands"&#x000A;PersonPrinter.say_hello(bro)      #=> "hey it's my brother, Bro!"&#x000A;PersonPrinter.say_hello(stranger) #=> "hello, Stranger"</code></pre>
  <aside class='notes'>
    <p>It&#39;s easy and convenient to pattern match on records.  Here&#39;s an example: [advance]</p>
    
    <p>You can see here that different function bodies match based on the content of the
    record that&#39;s passed as an argument.  This is the power of Pattern Matching as
    brought to bear on Records.</p>

<section>
  <h1>Pipe Operator</h1>
  <h2>|&gt;</h2>
  <pre class='fragment'><code>ps ax|grep vim|awk '{ print $1 }'</code></pre>
  <aside class='notes'>
    <p>The Pipe Operator is used to quickly and easily create a pipeline of functions.
    It&#39;s an extremely common thing you run into in various programming contexts.</p>
    
    <p>In Unix, a pipeline might look something like this: [advance]</p>
    
    <p>This would list the processes out, grep the resulting lines for the string <code>vim</code>,
    and print their PID.  There are substantially better ways to accomplish this, but
    it serves as a pretty comprehensible example.</p>
    
    <p>The reason Unix has a means of piping the output of one program into the input of
    another is that it&#39;s an exceedingly useful way of composing small operations into
    large, useful expressions.</p>
    
    <p>It turns out that that&#39;s most of what functional programming is, so you&#39;d expect
    the pipe operator to be very useful, and you&#39;d be right.  For the record, Elixir
    cribbed this from F#.</p>
    
    <p>In Elixir, the pipe operator takes the output of the expression on the left of
    it, and feeds it in as the first argument to the function on the right of it.
    Let&#39;s see what that looks like with some more live coding.</p>

  <h1>CODING CODING CODING</h1>

  <aside class='notes'>
    <p>For our example app, we&#39;ll take the output of our <code>ps</code> command as input, and
    we&#39;ll generate functions to serve as <code>grep</code> and <code>awk</code> for building out the same
    pipeline.</p>
    
    <p>We&#39;ll generate a new application:</p>
    
    <pre><code>mix new pipe_operator_playground&#x000A;cd pipe_operator_playground&#x000A;</code></pre>
    
    <p>Now let&#39;s go modify the existing test:</p>
    
    <pre><code>defmodule PipeOperatorPlaygroundTest do&#x000A;  use ExUnit.Case&#x000A;&#x000A;  test &quot;ps_ax outputs some processes&quot; do&#x000A;  end&#x000A;&#x000A;  test &quot;grep(thing) returns lines that match &#39;thing&#39;&quot; do&#x000A;  end&#x000A;&#x000A;  test &quot;awk(1) splits on whitespace and returns the first column&quot; do&#x000A;  end&#x000A;&#x000A;  test &quot;the whole pipeline works&quot; do&#x000A;  end&#x000A;end&#x000A;</code></pre>

  <h1>LIVE LIVE LIVE LIVE LIVE</h1>
  <h1>CODING CODING CODING</h1>
  <h1>ZOMG ZOMG ZOMG ZOMG</h1>
  <aside class='notes'>
    <p>So there&#39;s our rough shell.  Let&#39;s go ahead and start filling it in.</p>
    
    <pre><code>test &quot;ps_ax outputs some processes&quot; do&#x000A;  output = &quot;&quot;&quot;&#x000A;    PID TTY      STAT   TIME COMMAND&#x000A;   8544 ?        S      0:00 [kworker/u:1]&#x000A;  10919 pts/4    Sl+    0:14 vim 016_Pipe_Operator.markdown&#x000A;  10941 pts/5    Ss     0:00 -bash&#x000A;  13936 pts/5    Sl+    0:00 vim test/pipe_operator_playground_test.exs&#x000A;  14422 ?        S      0:00 sleep 3&#x000A;  &quot;&quot;&quot;&#x000A;  assert Unix.ps_ax == output&#x000A;end&#x000A;</code></pre>
    
    <p>Here we&#39;re just getting some basic test data in for our pipeline.  I just read
    in the ps command and stripped most of it out.  We just want to assert that we
    have a function, <code>Unix.ps_ax</code>, that outputs this data to get us started.  Let&#39;s
    go ahead and make the module and corresponding function:</p>
    
    <pre><code>defmodule Unix do&#x000A;  def ps_ax do&#x000A;    &quot;&quot;&quot;&#x000A;      PID TTY      STAT   TIME COMMAND&#x000A;     8544 ?        S      0:00 [kworker/u:1]&#x000A;    10919 pts/4    Sl+    0:14 vim 016_Pipe_Operator.markdown&#x000A;    10941 pts/5    Ss     0:00 -bash&#x000A;    13936 pts/5    Sl+    0:00 vim test/pipe_operator_playground_test.exs&#x000A;    14422 ?        S      0:00 sleep 3&#x000A;    &quot;&quot;&quot;&#x000A;  end&#x000A;end&#x000A;</code></pre>
    
    <p>We&#39;ll run the tests, and since we just copy-pasted the output of a function, I&#39;d
    be flabbergasted if they didn&#39;t succeed.</p>
  </aside>
</section>
<section>
  <h1>LIVE LIVE LIVE LIVE LIVE</h1>
  <h1>CODING CODING CODING</h1>
  <h1>ZOMG ZOMG ZOMG ZOMG</h1>
  <aside class='notes'>
    <p>Now that that&#39;s done with, let&#39;s fill in the next test:</p>
    
    <pre><code>test &quot;grep(thing) returns lines that match &#39;thing&#39;&quot; do&#x000A;  input = &quot;&quot;&quot;&#x000A;  foo&#x000A;  bar&#x000A;  thing foo&#x000A;  baz&#x000A;  thing qux&#x000A;  &quot;&quot;&quot;&#x000A;  output = [&quot;thing foo&quot;, &quot;thing qux&quot;]&#x000A;  assert Unix.grep(input, &#39;thing&#39;) == output&#x000A;end&#x000A;</code></pre>
    
    <p>Alright, here we&#39;re expecting to define a grep command that takes a regex of
    some sort to filter its input.  Let&#39;s see what that looks like:</p>
    
    <pre><code>def grep(input, match) do&#x000A;  lines = String.split(input, &quot;\n&quot;)&#x000A;  Enum.filter(lines, fn(line) -&gt; Regex.match?(%r/#{match}/, line) end)&#x000A;end&#x000A;</code></pre>
    
    <p>This would, hilariously, be a bit shorter if we were to use a pipeline for it,
    but we can always come back to that.  I&#39;m going to try to be laser-focused on
    the actual pipeline we&#39;re building, for now, for illustrative purposes.</p>
    
    <p>Go ahead and run the tests, and they&#39;ll pass.</p>
  </aside>
</section>
<section>
  <h1>LIVE LIVE LIVE LIVE LIVE</h1>
  <h1>CODING CODING CODING</h1>
  <h1>ZOMG ZOMG ZOMG ZOMG</h1>
  <aside class='notes'>
    <p>Let&#39;s see the next test:</p>
    
    <pre><code>test &quot;awk(1) splits on whitespace and returns the first column&quot; do&#x000A;  input = [&quot;foo bar&quot;, &quot;  baz    qux &quot;]&#x000A;  output = [&quot;foo&quot;, &quot;baz&quot;]&#x000A;  assert Unix.awk(input, 1) == output&#x000A;end&#x000A;</code></pre>
    
    <p>Alright, so here we&#39;re expecting to split on whitespace of some sort, and return
    the column we ask for.  Easy enough, let&#39;s go ahead and implement it:</p>
    
    <pre><code>def awk(lines, column) do&#x000A;  Enum.map(lines, fn(line) -&gt;&#x000A;    stripped = String.strip(line)&#x000A;    columns = Regex.split(%r/ /, stripped, trim: true)&#x000A;    Enum.at(columns, column-1)&#x000A;  end)&#x000A;end&#x000A;</code></pre>
    
    <p>Run the tests, they should all pass.</p>
  </aside>
</section>
<section>
  <h1>LIVE LIVE LIVE LIVE LIVE</h1>
  <h1>CODING CODING CODING</h1>
  <h1>ZOMG ZOMG ZOMG ZOMG</h1>
  <aside class='notes'>
    <p>Finally, let&#39;s see how we can glue these pieces together with the pipe operator,
    which was the whole flipping point of this exercise, right?</p>
    
    <pre><code>test &quot;the whole pipeline works&quot; do&#x000A;  assert (Unix.ps_ax |&gt; Unix.grep(&#39;vim&#39;) |&gt; Unix.awk(1)) == [&quot;10919&quot;, &quot;13936&quot;]&#x000A;end&#x000A;</code></pre>
    
    <p>Go ahead and run the test, and it should just work.  That&#39;s what a pipeline&#39;s
    good for - turning a whole lot of work into one small, easy to read piece.
    Without the pipeline, that would have been written:</p>
    
    <pre><code>Unix.awk(Unix.grep(Unix.ps_ax, &#39;vim&#39;), 1)&#x000A;</code></pre>
    
    <p>Which is just awful to read, especially if you look at the distance between
    &#39;awk&#39; and its argument specifying the column.</p>
    
    <p>Anyway, now that we&#39;ve played with the pipe a bit, let&#39;s clean up the rest of
    the pieces of this code that could benefit from pipelines:</p>
    
    <pre><code>def grep(input, match) do&#x000A;  String.split(input, &quot;\n&quot;)&#x000A;    |&gt; Enum.filter(fn(line) -&gt; Regex.match?(%r/#{match}/, line) end)&#x000A;end&#x000A;&#x000A;def awk(lines, column) do&#x000A;  Enum.map(lines, fn(line) -&gt;&#x000A;    stripped = String.strip(line)&#x000A;    Regex.split(%r/ /, stripped, trim: true)&#x000A;      |&gt; Enum.at(column-1)&#x000A;  end)&#x000A;end&#x000A;</code></pre>
  </aside>
</section>
<section>
  <h1>LIVE LIVE LIVE LIVE LIVE</h1>
  <h1>CODING CODING CODING</h1>
  <h1>ZOMG ZOMG ZOMG ZOMG</h1>
  <aside class='notes'>
    <p>You can see we can&#39;t easily pipeline through the <code>Regex.split</code> function.  This
      is kind of untrue - we can use it, but since it doesn&#39;t take the input string as
      the first argument, it looks exceedingly unwieldy.  Just to show you what this
      looks like, let me show you a way I would <em>not</em> suggest:</p>
    
    <pre><code>  def awk(lines, column) do&#x000A;    Enum.map(lines, fn(line) -&gt;&#x000A;      String.strip(line)&#x000A;        |&gt; (&amp;Regex.split(%r/ /, &amp;1, trim: true)).()&#x000A;        |&gt; Enum.at(column-1)&#x000A;    end)&#x000A;  end&#x000A;</code></pre>
    
    <p>So yeah, that&#39;s technically a thing you can do, but don&#39;t.</p>

    <p>We&#39;re not going to talk about it a ton, I just want to cover it briefly as a
    concept.  Recursive functions call themselves again.  To show this off, we&#39;ll
    just write a recursive function that can sum a list of numbers.</p>
  </aside>
</section>
<section>
  <h1>Recursion</h1>
  <pre><code>def sum_list(list) do&#x000A;  sum_list(list, 0)&#x000A;end&#x000A;def sum_list([next|rest], accum) do&#x000A;  sum_list(rest, accum + next)&#x000A;end&#x000A;def sum_list([], accum) do&#x000A;  accum&#x000A;end</code></pre>
  <aside class='notes'>
    <p>So here&#39;s a basic recursive function.  It&#39;s expected to be used in the first form,
    that takes a single argument.  Internally, it then calls its second form, which takes
    a list and an accumulator, where the accumulator is just accumulating the calculation
    as we go.  Finally, it has a pathological form that says &quot;we&#39;re done with this
    calculation&quot; and just returns its accumulator.</p>
    
    <p>We just pop the next item off of the list, add it to the accumulator, and then call
    <code>sum_list</code> on the remainder, updating the accumulator with the next step in the
    calculation.  Eventually we&#39;ve popped all of the items off of the list, and so we&#39;re
    done calculating and just return it.</p>
    
    <p>This is the core principle you&#39;ll follow in your recursive functions.  Also of note
    is that Elixir and Erlang support Tail Call Optimization, which basically means that
    if the last expression in a function is the recursive call to itself, it will not
    require an increasing stack size to handle the calculation.  If you tried to do this
    type of recursion in Ruby, you&#39;d run into Stack Overflow errors as there&#39;d be a new
    frame on the stack for each iteration of the function.</p>

    <p>What they are.  [advance]</p>
    
    <p>We&#39;re going to play with them a bit live [advance]</p>
    
    <p>And we&#39;re going to look at encapsulating state in a process.  Let&#39;s get started [advance]</p>

  <h1>Processes</h1>
  <h2>What they are</h2>
  <ul>
    <li class='fragment'>Elixir's unit of concurrency</li>
    <li class='fragment'>lightweight - not OS processes</li>
    <li class='fragment'>very often used the same way that objects are in ruby, etc.</li>
    <li class='fragment'>Each process is garbage collected on its own, so there's never a GC 'stop the world' situation</li>
  </ul>
  <aside class='notes'>
    <p>Erlang is a concurrency-oriented programming language, and consequently so is
    Elixir. [advance]</p>
    
    <p>Its unit of concurrency is the process [advance]</p>
    
    <p>(which has nothing to do with an Operating System process). [advance]</p>
    
    <p>If you&#39;ve heard people talking about the Actor Model, this is what they&#39;re talking
    about. [advance]</p>
    
    <p>Processes share no memory with one another, and can only communicate with each other
    via asynchronous messages.  They&#39;re each garbage collected independently, so there&#39;s
    never going to be a &#39;stop the world&#39; GC like you&#39;d have in Java, Ruby, etc.</p>

  <h2>Playing with them</h2>
  <aside class='notes'>
    <p>Since Elixir runs on top of the Erlang VM, it also supports concurrency via
    processes.  Let&#39;s see what that looks like.</p>

    <p>We&#39;ll go ahead and generate a new project:</p>
    
    <pre><code>mix new process_playground &amp;&amp; cd process_playground&#x000A;</code></pre>
    
    <p>Let&#39;s explore processes via tests.  Let&#39;s open up
    <code>test/ping_test.exs</code> and add the following:</p>
    
    <pre><code>defmodule PingTest do&#x000A;  use ExUnit.Case&#x000A;&#x000A;  test &quot;it responds to a pong with a ping&quot; do&#x000A;    ping = spawn_link(Ping, :start, [])&#x000A;    ping &amp;lt;- {:pong, self}&#x000A;    assert_receive {:ping, ping}&#x000A;  end&#x000A;end&#x000A;</code></pre>

    <ul>
    <li>Here is a test for a ping process.  This process responds to any message of the
    form <code>{:pong, pid}</code> by sending a message to that pid of the form <code>{:ping,&#x000A;self}</code> where self is its own pid, or Process ID.</li>
    <li><code>spawn_link</code> is used to spawn a new process and link it to the current
    process.  This just means that when the Ping process dies, the current process
    will be notified.  The return from <code>spawn_link</code> is the pid of the spawned
    process.</li>
    <li>Let&#39;s go ahead and run this test.  You&#39;ll notice it failing pretty
    immediately, as it has no idea what Ping is.  We&#39;ll just add the module and
    see what the next error message is.</li>
    <li>Now it&#39;s complaining that there&#39;s no <code>start</code> function, so we&#39;ll add that but
    it&#39;ll be empty.  Go ahead and run the tests again, and it should fail the
    assertion.  This is because we didn&#39;t send anything matching the pattern it
    was looking for.</li>
    <li>Now we&#39;ll learn about <code>receive</code>.  This is known as selective receive.  It
    accepts a series of potential patterns that can match messages in the
    process&#39;s mailbox, and provides a function body that is run for the next message
    in the mailbox that matches the appropriate pattern.</li>

    <p>Now I mentioned mailboxes a couple of times there.  They&#39;re a big part of the
    actor model.  A mailbox is exactly what it sounds like - messages for a given
    process get placed into its mailbox when they&#39;re delivered asynchronously, and
    the process can handle its messages with selective receive in whichever order it
    prefers.</p>
    
    <p>Finally, let&#39;s ensure that the ping server can handle more than one message.
    We&#39;ll do this by calling a function that will recursively call itself after
    handling each message sent to it.  I traditionally call this function <code>await</code>,
    for what it&#39;s worth.</p>
    
    <p>Let&#39;s go ahead and move Ping into its own file under lib, and make a new
    <code>pong_test.exs</code> file.  We&#39;ll copy in the Ping test, and we&#39;ll go through the
    same process really quickly.</p>

  <h1>Processes</h1>
  <h2>Encapsulating State</h2>
  <aside class='notes'>
    <p>A very common pattern, and one of the most powerful that Erlang and Elixir offer
    in my opinion, enables you to encapsulate state into a process in a way that
    makes it behave very much like an object in a traditional object oriented
    programming language.  That is, it has its own behaviour and state in one place.
    The pattern involves passing state into the <code>await</code> function from start, and
    then passing the state (potentially modified) into the recursive calls to await.
    Let&#39;s see what that would look like.  We&#39;ll make pong keep track of how many
    times it&#39;s been called, and it will print that out each time it responds.</p>
    
    <p>hack hack hack</p>
    
    <p>Alright, now that that&#39;s done we can, of course, wire Ping and Pong into one
    another and just sit back as our actors chatter among themselves autonomously.
    It&#39;s as easy as:</p>
    
    <pre><code>ping = spawn_link(Ping, :start, [])&#x000A;pong = spawn_link(Pong, :start, [])&#x000A;ping &amp;lt;- {:pong, pong}&#x000A;</code></pre>

  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <aside class='notes'>
    <p>Alright, that&#39;s it.  We&#39;ve covered what processes are, how to spawn them, and
    how to communicate with them.  We also learned a pattern for encapsulating
    state in a process, which is one of my favorite tricks.  That wraps up the
    Introduction to Elixir part of this talk, so let&#39;s take a decent length break.
    When you come back, we&#39;ll dig into using OTP with Elixir.</p>
