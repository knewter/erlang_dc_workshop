    <p>Hey everybody, welcome to the longest talk of my life.  By way of introduction,
    I&#39;m Josh Adams.</p>
    
    <p>I&#39;m on github as knewter.</p>
    
    <p>I&#39;m on the twitters as knewter.</p>
    
    <p>I&#39;m the CTO of a software development shop known as Isotope11 - we build stuff
    mostly in Ruby and JavaScript for various people - government agencies, startups,
    marketing firms, insurance agencies - we&#39;re not picky.</p>
    
    <p>I also run a screencast series in which I teach people Elixir as I learn it, which
    is in fact the reason I&#39;m standing up here today.  If you all subscribed I&#39;d be
    delighted and maybe I&#39;d stop losing money doing it :) You can find it at

      <p>We&#39;re going to speed through some data types here.  I won&#39;t call them all out because
      we&#39;re all sick of bullet points right now, but here they all are, laid out:</p>

    <h1>Data Types</h1>
    <h2>Atoms</h2>
    <p>
      Atoms are just like symbols in Ruby.  They consist of a colon, followed
      by letters, digits, and underscores
    </p>
    <pre><code>:foo&#x000A;:bar&#x000A;:"some string"&#x000A;:certain_@symbols_are_ok_too</code></pre>
    <aside class='notes'>
      <p>Atoms are just like symbols in Ruby.  They consist of a colon, followed
      by letters, digits, and underscores.</p>
      
      <p>Please forgive the syntax highlighting on this slide, the funky atoms are basically
      exactly the sort of thing my in-browser highlighter has trouble with.</p>
      
      <p>In Elixir and Erlang, atoms are used frequently to tag tuples.  You&#39;ll
      often see them as the first element in a tuple, used as a response type.  We&#39;ll
      see tuples a little later.</p>
    </aside>

  <section>
    <h1>Data Types</h1>
    <h2>Strings</h2>
    <pre><code>"foo" <> "bar" #=> "foobar"</code></pre>
    <aside class='notes'>
      <p>Strings in Elixir are Erlang binaries.  They are surrounded by double quotes.
      Here I&#39;m just showing basic string concatenation, to give you a feel for what
      that looks like.</p>
    </aside>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h1>Data Types</h1>
    <h2>Numbers - Integers</h2>
    <pre class='fragment'><code>1234567&#x000A;1_234_567&#x000A;1_234_567 == 1234567 # You can use underscores to make numbers easier to read&#x000A;12 + 24 # 36&#x000A;19 - 100 # -81&#x000A;</code></pre>
    <aside class='notes'>
      <p>Integers can be written in various ways.  Let&#39;s see a few: [advance]</p>
      
      <p>In Elixir, there&#39;s no limit on how large an integer can be.  You can do normal
      sorts of things with these integers. [advance]</p>
    </aside>

    <h1>Data Types</h1>
    <h2>Numbers - Floating Points</h2>
    <pre><code>1.23&#x000A;350.72&#x000A;.25 #=> (SyntaxError) iex:1: syntax error before: '.'</code></pre>
    <aside class='notes'>
      <p>Floating point numbers have a decimal point.</p>
      
      <p>Notice that there must be a number on both sides of the decimal in order to have
      a valid floating point number. [advance]</p>
    </aside>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h1>Data Types</h1>
    <h2>Lists</h2>
    <p>Lists look like arrays in other languages.</p>
    <pre class='fragment'><code>[1,2,3]&#x000A;[:foo, :bar]&#x000A;[:also, [:they, :can], [:contain, :lists]]</code></pre>
    <p class='fragment'>
      They're actually just implemented as linked lists.
    </p>
    <p class='fragment'>
      You can get their head (hd) and tail (tl).
    </p>
    <pre class='fragment'><code>a = [1, 2, 3]&#x000A;hd(a) # 1&#x000A;tl(a) # [2, 3]</code></pre>
    <aside class='notes'>
      <p>Lists look like arrays in other languages, although they have different
      semantics.  Writing a list is easy [advance]</p>
      
      <p>Due to the way they&#39;re implemented, the easiest thing to do with a list is to
      get its head or its tail - that is, the first element in the list, or all the
      remaining elements in a list. [advance]</p>
      
      <p>This is because they are actually just linked lists. [advance]</p>
      
      <p>There are a couple of built in functions for accessing the head and tail of a list.
      <code>hd</code> and <code>tl</code>. [advance]</p>
      
      <p>If you want something more like arrays, then you want tuples. [advance]</p>
    </aside>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h1>Data Types</h1>
    <h2>Tuples</h2>
    <p>Tuples are ordered collections:</p>
    <pre class='fragment'><code>{1, 2, 3}&#x000A;{:foo, :bar}</code></pre>
    <aside class='notes'>
      <p>Tuples are ordered collections. [advance]</p>
      
      <p>Tuples are used very frequently in Pattern Matching and in return values from
      various functions (those two facts are not unrelated). [advance]</p>
    </aside>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h1>Data Types</h1>
    <h2>Keyword Lists</h2>
    <p>Like Hashes or Dicts</p>
    <pre class='fragment'><code>[author: "Josh Adams", title: "Basic Elixir"]</code></pre>
    <p class='fragment'>
      That's just converted into an array of 2-element tuples, so that's the same as
      the following:
    </p>
    <pre class='fragment'><code>[{:author, "Josh Adams"}, {:title, "Basic Elixir"}]</code></pre>
    <aside class='notes'>
      <p>Keyword lists are like hashes or dicts. [advance]</p>
      
      <p>That&#39;s just converted into an array of 2-element tuples, so that&#39;s the same as
      the following: [advance]</p>
      
      <p>In Erlang, keyword lists don&#39;t exist as a first-level construct.  Elixir
      provides some syntactic sugar around some core Erlang types to provide
      Keyword Lists.  These serve the same purpose as hashes in Ruby. [advance]</p>
    </aside>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h1>Data Types</h1>
    <h2>Regular Expressions</h2>
    <p>Elixir has Perl Compatible Regular Expressions.</p>
    <pre class='fragment'><code>Regex.replace %r/[aeiou]/, "Beginning Elixir", "z" #=> "Bzgznnzng Elzxzr"</code></pre>
    <aside class='notes'>
      <p>If you aren&#39;t familiar with Regular Expressions, think of them as a concise way
      to write rules for pattern matching a string.  If you <em>are</em> familiar with Regexes,
      Elixir has Perl Compatible Regular Expressions, so you can mostly use them like you&#39;re
      used to: [advance]</p>
      
      <p>You use the &#39;r&#39; sigil to build a regex (where sigil is just a concise word for
      &#39;bit of syntax that is a percent sign followed by some letter) - Ruby uses sigils
      to great effect, and I&#39;m glad to see them in Elixir. [advance]</p>
    </aside>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h1>Data Types</h1>
    <h2>Booleans</h2>
    <pre><code>false = :false&#x000A;true = :true</code></pre>
    <aside class='notes'>
      <p>In Elixir, everything but <code>false</code> or <code>nil</code> is truthy.  <code>false</code> and <code>nil</code> are
      both shorthands for the atoms with the same name - namely, <code>:false</code> and <code>:nil</code>.</p>

      <li class='fragment'>Function Definitions</li>
      <li class='fragment'>Case Statements</li>
    </ul>
    <aside class='notes'>
      <p>And that&#39;s it for the data types.  Next, we&#39;re moving on to various places you&#39;ll
      make use of pattern matching: [advance down]</p>
      
      <ul>
      <li>The match operator [advance]</li>
      <li>Function definitions [advance]</li>
      <li>and Case statements [advance]</li>
      </ul>

  <section>
    <h1>Pattern Matching</h1>
    <h2>Match Operator</h2>
    <p>"Just the equals sign"</p>
    <pre class='fragment'><code>foo = 1</code></pre>
    <div class='fragment'>
      <p>Not really...</p>
      <pre><code>1 = foo</code></pre>
    </div>
    <div class='fragment'>
      <pre><code>2 = foo #=> ** (MatchError) no match of right hand side value: 1</code></pre>
    </div>
    <aside class='notes'>
      <p>The &#39;Match Operator&#39; is just the equals sign.  It looks like variable assignment
      at first glance, but there&#39;s something fishy about it: [advance]</p>
      
      <p>This sets the previously-unbound variable &#39;foo&#39; to the integer 1.  That&#39;s just
      assignment, right? [advance]</p>
      
      <p>Not really.  If the equals sign is an assignment operator, why was that a valid
      expression? It turns out the match operator is really more like making an
      assertion than it is assignment - it just turns out that if you assert an unbound
      variable matches a value, Elixir will bind the variable and the assertion will
      pass. [advance]</p>
      
      <p><code>foo</code> already had the value 1, so the match fails and the <code>MatchError</code> is
      thrown.  Since so many things depend on Pattern Matching, I&#39;m willing to bet you
      will run into <code>MatchError</code> quite often as you&#39;re learning.  I certainly do (both
      here and when I was learning Erlang). [advance]</p>
    </aside>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h1>Pattern Matching</h1>
    <h2>Match Operator (cont)</h2>
    <p>Here's some more advanced matches</p>
    <pre class='fragment'><code>{:foo, bar} = {:foo, 3}</code></pre>
    <pre class='fragment'><code>{_, baz} = {1, 2}&#x000A;baz #=> 2</code></pre>
    <aside class='notes'>
      <p>Let&#39;s try some more advanced matches, to further explore how what we&#39;re dealing
      with is something entirely different from assignment.[advance]</p>
      
      <p>What does this expression do?  Anyone care to answer?  That&#39;s right, it assigns
      bar to 3, so that the match would be successful.</p>
      
      <p>Underscores play an interesting role in Elixir.  They tell the compiler that you
      don&#39;t care about the value in a given position in a Pattern you&#39;re matching on.
      Sort of like a wildcard for Pattern Matching.  Here&#39;s an example: [advance]</p>
      
      <p>Imagine we knew that the value we were interested in in the data structure we
      were matching was in its second position, and we didn&#39;t care about the other
      components.  The underscore provides a clear signal to the compiler that we just
      don&#39;t care about that value. [advance]</p>
    </aside>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h1>Pattern Matching</h1>
    <h2>Match Operator (cont)</h2>
    <pre><code>[a, 2] = [1, 2] # After this expression a is bound to 1&#x000A;[a, 2] = [3, 2] # Here, a gets re-bound to 3&#x000A;[^a, 2] = [4, 2] # MatchError, because the hat keeps a from re-binding&#x000A;</code></pre>
    <aside class='notes'>
      <p>Finally, there&#39;s one more important point in Elixir that&#39;s different than Erlang
      and confused me for a bit.  If you want to use a variable in a pattern match as
      a filter (i.e. you want a MatchError thrown if the data on the righthand side
      doesn&#39;t match the presently-bound value in a given variable) then you need to
      signal to the compiler that you don&#39;t want to re-bind the variable.  This can be
      done with the caret-symbol, or hat (^).</p>
      
      <p>In Erlang, you cannot modify a variable once it&#39;s been bound.  Elixir removes
      this restriction, and so they had to provide this facility to differentiate
      between variable binding and variables used for matches.  It&#39;s a decent
      trade-off. [advance]</p>
    </aside>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h1>Pattern Matching</h1>
    <h2>Function Definitions</h2>
    <p>Pattern matching lets you choose amont multiple definitions of a function.</p>
    <pre class='fragment'><code>print_name_egotistically = fn&#x000A;  :josh -> "Your name is Josh!"&#x000A;  _     -> "I don't care what your name is!"&#x000A;end&#x000A;print_name_egotistically.(:josh)&#x000A;#=> "Your name is Josh!"&#x000A;print_name_egotistically.(:phil)&#x000A;#=> "I don't care what your name is!"&#x000A;</code></pre>
    <aside class='notes'>
      <p>Pattern matching is used to choose between multiple possible definitions of a
      function.  As an example, I&#39;ll define a silly function: [advance]</p>
      
      <p>That function has a different function definition depending on the pattern
      matching for its arguments.  This is the first intensely different sort of thing
      that we&#39;ve run into in Elixir so far.  As I was a math major in college, when I
      first ran across this sort of thing in Erlang it got me really excited, as
      that&#39;s really how I often like to see a function defined. [advance]</p>
    </aside>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h1>Pattern Matching</h1>
    <h2>Case Statements</h2>
    <p>
      Case Statements can be used for control flow, and they, too, operate based on
      Pattern Matching.
    </p>
    <pre class='fragment'><code>case {1,2,3} do&#x000A;  {4,5,6} -> "No match here"&#x000A;  {1,2,3} -> "This matches"&#x000A;  {_,2,3} -> "This would match, but since it's below another match it isn't hit."&#x000A;end</code></pre>
    <aside class='notes'>
      <p>Case Statements can be used for control flow, and they, too, operate based on
      Pattern Matching. [advance]</p>
      
      <p>Here you can see the middle case is what&#39;s going to match.  The first one just doesn&#39;t
      match.  The second one matches.  The third one would match, but since it&#39;s below another
      match it&#39;s not going to get executed, as the first pattern to match gets precedence.</p>

      <p>That&#39;s it for the basics of Pattern Matching, let&#39;s move on to functions.</p>
      
      <p>In Elixir, functions are first class types.  This shouldn&#39;t be terribly
      surprising; it <em>is</em> a functional programming language, after all.  Let&#39;s look at:</p>

    <h2>Defining Them</h2>
    <pre class='fragment'><code>print_name = fn&#x000A;  {:person, first_name, last_name} -> first_name <> " " <> last_name&#x000A;end</code></pre>
    <aside class='notes'>
      <p>Anonymous functions are defined with the <code>fn</code> keyword.  Let&#39;s see what that
      looks like: [advance]</p>
      
      <p>Functions take parameter lists and bodies, separated by arrows (<code>-&gt;</code>).  The
      parameter lists are used for Pattern Matching (we actually saw function
      declaration in the last section on Pattern Matching).</p>
      
      <p>The <code>print_name</code> function above will match a tuple containing three elements,
      when the first element is the atom <code>:person</code>.  It then matches to a body that
      will concatenate the first and last names together (where by convention, we
      assume they will be in the second and third positions in the tuple). [advance]</p>
    </aside>

    <h2>Calling Them</h2>
    <p>
      The syntax to call an anonymous function in Elixir is a little weird looking at
      first.  Let's see what it looks like:
    </p>
    <pre class='fragment'><code>print_name.({:person, "Josh", "Adams"})&#x000A;#=> "Josh Adams"</code></pre>
    <pre class='fragment'><code>print_name.('foo')&#x000A;# ** (FunctionClauseError) no function clause matching in :erl_eval."-inside-an-interpreted-fun-"/1</code></pre>
    <aside class='notes'>
      <p>The syntax to call an anonymous function in Elixir is a little weird looking at
      first.  Let&#39;s see what it looks like: [advance]</p>
      
      <p>That&#39;s easy enough, although the dot makes calling them feel different from
      calling functions in modules..  What do you think happens if you try to call it
      with an argument that doesn&#39;t match any of the parameter lists? [advance]</p>
      
      <p>It throws a FunctionClauseError.  It&#39;s worth noting that there&#39;s currently an
      ongoing discussion regarding removing that dot to call anonymous functions. [advance]</p>
    </aside>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h1>Functions</h1>
    <h2>Calling Them (cont)</h2>
    <pre class='fragment'><code>calculate_bill = fn&#x000A;  [{:item, price}, {:item, price2}] -> price + price2&#x000A;  {:item, price} -> price&#x000A;end</code></pre>
    <pre class='fragment'><code>calculate_bill.([{:item, 20}, {:item, 10}]) #=> 30&#x000A;calculate_bill.({:item, 35}) #=> 35</code></pre>
    <pre class='fragment'><code>(fn -> "foo" end).()&#x000A;#=> "foo"</code></pre>
    <aside class='notes'>
      <p>Let&#39;s define an anonymous function that behaves differently depending on the
      argument provided: [advance]</p>
      
      <p>So we&#39;ve got an anonymous function here.  If you give it a list of two items, it
      will return the sum of their prices.  If you give it a single item, it just returns
      the price.</p>
      
      <p>Now, this is in fact a silly way to define this function (recursion would make
      more sense, so you could accept more than 2 items), but for the purposes of
      demonstrating Pattern Matching in functions it&#39;s acceptable. [advance]</p>
      
      <p>Now you can call this function with either a single item or a list containing
      two items, and it will return the price.  It works like this: [advance]</p>
      
      <p>So that worked, but like we said, it&#39;s pretty low-utility - it can only accept
      one or two items, tops.  I was going to follow up here by defining the function
      recursively, but recursive anonymous functions in Elixir require a bit of
      finagling with the Y combinator, so I won&#39;t cover that yet. [advance]</p>
      
      <p>One more fun thing that you can do with anonymous functions is invoke them
      immediately.  For instance: [advance]</p>
      
      <p>Obviously that, too, is a pretty unlikely example, but it serves to show off
      immediate invocation, none the less. [advance]</p>

    <h2>Compiling a module</h2>
    <p>You can get a file compiled and available in an `iex` session in two ways:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class='fragment'>Launch `iex` with the module as an argument</li>
      <li class='fragment'>Use `elixirc` and launch iex from the dir with the beam</li>
    </ul>
    <aside class='notes'>
      <p>There are two ways to get the file compiled and into an <code>iex</code> session. [advance]</p>
      
      <p>The first is to just launch <code>iex</code> with a module as an argument.  We&#39;ll do that
      and verify that we can call this function.</p>
      
      <blockquote>
      <p>open up an iex session with <code>iex lib/modules_example/publisher.ex</code>, then call
      ModulesExample.Publisher.publish(&quot;foo&quot;)</p>
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>(once that was successful, switch back to slides and [advance])</p>
      
      <p>The second way to compile the module is by using <code>elixirc</code>.  This ships with elixir,
      and can be invoked by <code>elixirc lib/modules_example/publisher.ex</code>.  It will
      generate a file named <code>Elixir.ModulesExample.Publisher.beam</code> in the current
      directory.  If you launch <code>iex</code> from that directory, the module will also be
      available to you.</p>
      
      <blockquote>
      <p>Go ahead and compile it with elixirc and launch iex with no arguments, then
      call ModulesExample.Publisher.publish(&quot;foo&quot;)</p>

    <h2>Module definitions have return values</h2>
    <pre class='fragment'><code>{:module, Foo,&#x000A; <<70, 79, 82, 49, 0, 0, 7, 24, 66, 69, 65, 77, 65, 116, 111, 109, 0, 0, 0, 102,&#x000A;0, 0, 0, 11, 10, 69, 108, 105, 120, 105, 114, 46, 70, 111, 111, 8, 95, 95, 105,&#x000A;110, 102, 111, 95, 95, 4, 100, 111, 99, 115, 9, ...>>,&#x000A; {:bar, 0}}&#x000A;</code></pre>
    <aside class='notes'>
      <p>In Elixir, you can also just define a module directly inside the REPL.  For
      someone that&#39;s coming from Erlang, this will be a bit surprising.  There&#39;s a
      really interesting feature that comes out of defining a module.  To see what&#39;s
      happening, we&#39;ll define one in iex.</p>
      
      <p>(Open up an iex and type the following)</p>
      
      <pre><code>output = defmodule Foo do&#x000A;  def bar do&#x000A;    &quot;whee&quot;&#x000A;  end&#x000A;end&#x000A;</code></pre>
      
      <p>You&#39;ll notice that <code>defmodule</code> returns a tuple.  It actually has a really neat
      structure. [Go back to slides, and advance]</p>
      
      <p>The tuple contains, in the following order:</p>
      
      <ul>
      <li>An atom, <code>:module</code></li>
      <li>The constant representing the module: <code>Foo</code></li>
      <li>A binary containing the bytecode defining the module.  This is extremely
      interesting, as it can be used to (for instance) shove this module over
      into another node and load it over the network without that node ever having
      had the source code available to it.</li>
      <li>A tuple describing the last function defined in that module.  This is actually
      just because the last item in the module definition return value tuple is just
      the return value of the last executed expression in the module.  This happens
      to be the return value of defining a function, which is itself a tuple containing
      the function name and arity.</li>
      </ul>

    <h2>Documenting a module</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Module and Function Documentation are first-class</li>
      <li>Use module attributes (beginning with @) to define them</li>
      <li class='fragment'>Acces a module's docs using the `h` helper in `iex`</li>
    </ul>
    <aside class='notes'>
      <p>Elixir supports module and function documentation as first-class constructs.
      They can be defined with the help of things known as module attributes.  These
      begin with an <code>@</code> within a module.</p>
      
      <p>Let&#39;s open up the <code>ModulesExample.Publisher</code> module from before and add documentation
      to it. This is achieved by using the <code>@moduledoc</code> and <code>@doc</code> attributes.  You pass them
      a heredoc, and it may contain markdown formatting.</p>
      
      <p>(switch to a vim session, and add the following)</p>
      
      <pre><code># in lib/modules_example/publisher.ex&#x000A;defmodule ModulesExample.Publisher do&#x000A;  @moduledoc &quot;&quot;&quot;&#x000A;    A module used for training in [ElixirSips](http://www.elixirsips.com).&#x000A;  &quot;&quot;&quot;&#x000A;&#x000A;  @doc &quot;&quot;&quot;&#x000A;    Returns the message it is provided.  This is *extremely* valuable!&#x000A;  &quot;&quot;&quot;&#x000A;  def publish(message) do&#x000A;    message&#x000A;  end&#x000A;end&#x000A;</code></pre>
      
      <p>[advance]</p>
      
      <p>You can access a module&#39;s documentation using the <code>h</code> helper in <code>iex</code>.  To see
      this in action, we&#39;ll launch iex with <code>iex lib/modules_example/publisher.ex</code></p>
      
      <p>(switch to iex)</p>
      
      <pre><code>h(ModulesExample.Publisher)&#x000A;# So that&#39;s the module&#39;s moduledoc.  Let&#39;s see a function&#39;s doc&#x000A;h(ModulesExample.Publisher.publish)&#x000A;</code></pre>

    <h2>Documenting a module (cont)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Generate docs as html with ExDoc</li>
    </ul>
    <aside class='notes'>
      <p>So that&#39;s one way of looking at documentation - it&#39;s very convenient to have
      access to documentation directly from your REPL, and it&#39;s a great feature of the
      language.</p>
      
      <p>You can also generate documentation as html (which makes the markdown
      support...useful).  To generate documentation for this module, you&#39;ll use ExDoc
      by way of <code>mix</code>.</p>
      
      <p>We need to add ExDoc as a dependency for our project, so <code>mix</code> can install it
      for us.  We&#39;ll open up mix.exs and add the dependency:</p>
      
      <p>(open up mix.exs in vim)</p>
      
      <pre><code>defmodule ModulesExample.Mixfile do&#x000A;  ...&#x000A;  defp deps do&#x000A;    [&#x000A;      { :ex_doc, github: &quot;elixir-lang/ex_doc&quot; }&#x000A;    ]&#x000A;  end&#x000A;end&#x000A;</code></pre>
      
      <p>Now get mix to install our dependencies, then we&#39;ll generate the documentation:</p>
      
      <p>(in a shell)</p>
      
      <pre><code>mix deps.get&#x000A;mix docs&#x000A;</code></pre>
      
      <p>And that&#39;s it, nice documentation output for your modules! (open up in the browser)</p>
