# ErlangDC Elixir Workshop

This is the code and text for a three hour elixir workshop on December 7, 2013
in Washington, D.C. for the ErlangDC one day conference.

## Running it
To run this presentation, do the following:

```
bundle # Then make sure you've done a `git submodule init; git submodule update` in the reveal-ck gem
cd reveal_deck/introduction_to_elixir/basic_elixir/
reveal-ck generate
servedir # this is an alias I have that just does `ruby -run -e httpd . -p 9091` to serve current dir files on port 9091
```

## Prep Work
There will be live coding examples, so go ahead and get a tmux session open on
both monitors so you don't have to look at the screen to see what you're typing:

In one terminal, which goes on your laptop screen:

```sh
tmux
# (then rename the session to 'examples')
```

And in another, which goes on the projector:

```sh
tmux a -t examples
```
